Starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU - Andrej Karpathy tutoral on making gpt 2 from scratch. 

I wanted to go through this extensive 4 hour tutorial to gain deep fundational knowlege on GPT. Open Ai release the source code for GPT 2 and it is light weight 
making it perfect tool to play with. 

WIP:

From there the goal is toy with the infrastrucre see how I can make small changes in things like normalization, dropping out layers, or making funmential shifts in layer arrangment. 

Fine-tune a few models and add a small RAG. 

Create a final pipeline for a working system.

Finally have a UI with streamlit to see in action easily.
